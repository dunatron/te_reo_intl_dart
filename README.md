# te_reo_intl_dart

te-reo translation for materialFlutter to use as a delegate

## Getting Started

Most of this has been translated using google translate and only half of the file has been done.
it is basically needed when you go to add `mi` as A Locale. Since we want to use all the nice translations flutter has done already we will need to add this in
